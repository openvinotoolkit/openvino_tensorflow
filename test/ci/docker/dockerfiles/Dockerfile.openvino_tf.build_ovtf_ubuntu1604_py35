# python3-dev is needed for TensorFlow build
# git is needed to clone tensorflow repository
# unzip and wget are needed for installing bazel
# sudo is required for installing the TF wheel into /usr/local/...
# zlib1g, zlib1g-dev and bash-completion are required by bazel install
# zip and golang-go are needed to run TensorFlow tests
# curl and locate are needed by Tensorflow's configure command
# clang-format-3.9 is needed for code-style checks

# The "locate" command uses a prepopulated index.  If this index is not built,
# then "locate" will find absolutely nothing.  In Tensorflow's configure,
# this manifests itself as a silent failure of the configure script to run to
# completion.  Therefore, updatedb MUST BE RUN to provide an index for "locate".

#   bug in setuptools: "_NamespacePath object has no attribute sort"

# Copy in the run-as-user.sh script
# This will allow the builds, which are done in a mounted directory, to
# be run as the user who runs "docker run".  This then allows the mounted
# directory to be properly deleted by the user later (e.g. by jenkins).
