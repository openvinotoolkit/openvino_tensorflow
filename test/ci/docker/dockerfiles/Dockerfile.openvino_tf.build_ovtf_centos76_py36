# Environment to build and unit-test openvino_tensorflow on CentOS 7.6

FROM centos:7.6.1810

# Python environment is python 3.6, which is preferred Py3 on CentOS 7.6
# git is needed to clone tensorflow repository
# unzip and wget are needed for installing bazel
# sudo is required for installing the TF wheel into /usr/local/...
# zlib-dev and bash-completion are required by bazel install
# zip is needed to run TensorFlow tests
# wget is used below to get the bazel distro
# curl and mlocate are needed by Tensorflow's configure command
# "which" is needed to unpack bazel
# gcc, gcc-c++, and cmake3 are needed to build ngraph

# The "locate" command uses a prepopulated index.  If this index is not built,
# then "locate" will find absolutely nothing.  In Tensorflow's configure,
# this manifests itself as a silent failure of the configure script to run to
# completion.  Therefore, updatedb MUST BE RUN to provide an index for "locate".

# directory to be properly deleted by the user later (e.g. by jenkins).
