# APIs and environment variables for **OpenVINO™ integration with TensorFlow**

This document describes available Python APIs for **OpenVINO™ integration with TensorFlow**. The first section covers the essential APIs and lines of code required to leverage the functionality of **OpenVINO™ integration with TensorFlow** in TensorFlow applications.

## APIs for essential functionality

To add the **OpenVINO™ integration with TensorFlow** package to your TensorFlow python application, import the package using this line of code:

    import openvino_tensorflow

By default, CPU backend is enabled. You can set a different backend by using the following API:

    openvino_tensorflow.set_backend('<backend_name>')

Supported backends include 'CPU', 'GPU', 'GPU_FP16', 'MYRIAD', and 'VAD-M'.

## Additional APIs

To determine available backends on your system, use the following API:

    openvino_tensorflow.list_backends()

To check if the **OpenVINO™ integration with TensorFlow** is enabled, use the following API:

    openvino_tensorflow.is_enabled()

To get the assigned backend, use the following API:

    openvino_tensorflow.get_backend()

To enable verbose logs of the execution of the full TensorFlow pipeline and placement stages along with the **OpenVINO™ integration with TensorFlow**, use the following API:

    openvino_tensorflow.start_logging_placement()

To disable verbose logs of the execution of the full TensorFlow pipeline and placement stages along with the **OpenVINO™ integration with TensorFlow**, use the following API:

    openvino_tensorflow.stop_logging_placement()

To check if the placement logs are enabled, use the following API:

    openvino_tensorflow.is_logging_placement()

To check the CXX11_ABI used to compile **OpenVINO™ integration with TensorFlow**, use the following API:

    openvino_tensorflow.cxx11_abi_flag()

To disable execution of certain operators on the OpenVINO™ backend, use the following API to run them on native TensorFlow runtime:

    openvino_tensorflow.set_disabled_ops(<string_of_operators_separated_by_commas>)

 The string of operators should be separated with commas and provided as an argument to the above API.

 To check the list of disabled operators which are declared as supported by the backend, but disabled programmatically, use the following API:

    openvino_tensorflow.get_disabled_ops()

To enable or disable dynamic fallback, use the following API (When enabled, clusters causing errors during runtime can fall back to native TensorFlow although they are assigned to run on OpenVINO™).

    openvino_tensorflow.enable_dynamic_fallback()
    openvino_tensorflow.disable_dynamic_fallback()

To export the translated Intermediate Representation (IR) of the clusters to a directory, use the API below. This API will export and save the IRs from the most recently executed model as ".xml" and ".bin" files, which can be used for an OpenVINO™ application later. The first parameter to this API is the output directory. If there is any pre-existing IR file in the corresponding directory, it will ask the user to confirm before overwriting any of the older files. To disable this check, pass a "False" value as the second parameter(optional). Then, any pre-existing IR files will be overwritten without any confirmation if the IR file name is the same.

    openvino_tensorflow.export_ir("output/directory/path")

or

    openvino_tensorflow.export_ir("output/directory/path", False)

## Environment Variables

**OPENVINO_TF_CONVERT_VARIABLES_TO_CONSTANTS**

This variable is enabled by default, and it freezes variables from TensorFlow's ReadVariableOp as constants during the graph translation phase. Highly recommended to keep it enabled to ensure optimal inference latencies on eagerly executed models. Disable it when model weights are modified after loading the model for inference.

**OPENVINO_TF_DISABLE_DEASSIGN_CLUSTERS:**
After clusters are formed, some of the clusters may still fall back to native TensorFlow (e.g a cluster is too small, some conditions are not supported by the target device). If this variable is set, clusters will not be dropped and forced to run on OpenVINO™ backend. This may reduce the performance gain or may lead the execution to crash in some cases.

Example:

    OPENVINO_TF_DISABLE_DEASSIGN_CLUSTERS="1"

**OPENVINO_TF_VLOG_LEVEL:**
This variable is used to print the execution logs. Setting it to 1 will print the minumum amount of details and setting it to 5 will print the most detailed logs.

Example:

    OPENVINO_TF_VLOG_LEVEL="4"

**OPENVINO_TF_LOG_PLACEMENT:**
If this variable is set to 1, it will print the logs related to cluster formation and encapsulation.

Example:

    OPENVINO_TF_LOG_PLACEMENT="1"

**OPENVINO_TF_BACKEND:**
Backend device name can be set using this variable. It should be set to "CPU", "GPU", "GPU_FP16", "MYRIAD", or "VAD-M".

Example:

    OPENVINO_TF_BACKEND="MYRIAD"

**OPENVINO_TF_DISABLED_OPS:**
A list of disabled operators can be passed using this variable. These operators will not be considered for clustering and they will fall back on to native TensorFlow.

Example:

    OPENVINO_TF_DISABLED_OPS="Squeeze,Greater,Gather,Unpack"

**OPENVINO_TF_CONSTANT_FOLDING:**
This will enable/disable constant folding pass on the translated clusters (Disabled by default).

Example:

    OPENVINO_TF_CONSTANT_FOLDING="1"

**OPENVINO_TF_TRANSPOSE_SINKING:**
This will enable/disable transpose sinking pass on the translated clusters (Enabled by default).

Example:

    OPENVINO_TF_TRANSPOSE_SINKING="0"

**OPENVINO_TF_ENABLE_BATCHING:**
If this parameter is set to 1 while using VAD-M as the backend, the backend engine will divide the input into multiple asynchronous requests to utilize all devices in VAD-M to achieve better performance.

Example:

    OPENVINO_TF_ENABLE_BATCHING="1"

**OPENVINO_TF_DUMP_GRAPHS:**
Setting this will serialize the full graphs in all stages during the optimization pass and save them in the current directory.

Example:

    OPENVINO_TF_DUMP_GRAPHS=1

**OPENVINO_TF_DUMP_CLUSTERS:**
Setting this variable to 1 will serialize all the clusters in ".pbtxt" format and save them in the current directory.

Example:

    OPENVINO_TF_DUMP_CLUSTERS=1

**OPENVINO_TF_DISABLE:**
Disables **OpenVINO™ integration with TensorFlow** if set to 1.

Example:

    OPENVINO_TF_DISABLE=1

**OPENVINO_TF_MIN_NONTRIVIAL_NODES:**
This variable sets the minimum number of operators that can exist in a cluster. If the number of operators is smaller than the specified number, the cluster will fall back to TensorFlow. By default, it is calculated based on the total graph size, but it cannot be less than 6 unless it is set manually. (No performance benefit is observed by enabling very small clusters).

Example:

    OPENVINO_TF_MIN_NONTRIVIAL_NODES=10

**OPENVINO_TF_DYNAMIC_FALLBACK**
This variable enables or disables dynamic fallback feature. Should be set to "0" to disable and "1" to enable dynamic fallback. When enabled, clusters causing errors during runtime can fallback to native TensorFlow although they are assigned to run on OpenVINO™. Enabled by default.

Example:

    OPENVINO_TF_DYNAMIC_FALLBACK=0

## GPU Precision

The default precision for Intel<sup>®</sup> Integrated GPU (iGPU) is FP32. So, if you set the backend name as **'GPU'**, the execution on iGPU will be operated on FP32 precision. To change the iGPU precision to FP16, use the device name **'GPU_FP16'**.

Example for setting the iGPU precision to FP32:

    openvino_tensorflow.set_backend('GPU')

or

    OPENVINO_TF_BACKEND="GPU"

Example for setting the iGPU precision to FP16:

    openvino_tensorflow.set_backend('GPU_FP16')

or

    OPENVINO_TF_BACKEND="GPU_FP16"
