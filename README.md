# **OpenVINO™ integration with TensorFlow**

This repository contains the source code of **OpenVINO™ integration with TensorFlow**, designed for TensorFlow* developers who want to get started with [OpenVINO™](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/openvino-toolkit.html) in their inferencing applications. TensorFlow* developers can now take advantage of [OpenVINO™](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/openvino-toolkit.html) toolkit optimizations with TensorFlow inference applications across a wide range of Intel® compute devices by adding just two lines of code.

    import openvino_tensorflow
    openvino_tensorflow.set_backend('<backend_name>')

This product delivers [OpenVINO™](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/openvino-toolkit.html) inline optimizations which enhance inferencing performance with minimal code modifications.  **OpenVINO™ integration with TensorFlow accelerates** inference across many AI models on a variety of Intel<sup>®</sup> silicon such as:

- Intel<sup>®</sup> CPUs
- Intel<sup>®</sup> integrated GPUs
- Intel<sup>®</sup> Movidius™ Vision Processing Units - referred to as VPU
- Intel<sup>®</sup> Vision Accelerator Design with 8 Intel Movidius™ MyriadX VPUs - referred to as VAD-M or HDDL

[Note: For maximum performance, efficiency, tooling customization, and hardware control, we recommend the developers to adopt native OpenVINO™ APIs and its runtime.]

## Installation
### Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 18.04, 20.04, macOS 11.2.3 or Windows<sup>1</sup> 10 - 64 bit
- Python* 3.7, 3.8 or 3.9
- TensorFlow* v2.9.2

<sup>1</sup>Windows package supports only Python3.9 

Check our [Interactive Installation Table](https://openvinotoolkit.github.io/openvino_tensorflow/) for a menu of installation options. The table will help you configure the installation process.

The **OpenVINO™ integration with TensorFlow** package comes with pre-built libraries of OpenVINO™ version 2022.2.0. The users do not have to install OpenVINO™ separately. This package supports:
- Intel<sup>®</sup> CPUs
- Intel<sup>®</sup> integrated GPUs
- Intel<sup>®</sup> Movidius™ Vision Processing Units (VPUs)


        pip3 install -U pip
        pip3 install tensorflow==2.9.2
        pip3 install openvino-tensorflow==2.2.0

For installation instructions on Windows please refer to [**OpenVINO™ integration with TensorFlow** for Windows ](docs/INSTALL.md#windows)

To use Intel<sup>®</sup> integrated GPUs for inference, make sure to install the [Intel® Graphics Compute Runtime for OpenCL™ drivers](https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/openvino_docs_install_guides_installing_openvino_linux.html#install-gpu)

To leverage Intel® Vision Accelerator Design with Movidius™ (VAD-M) for inference, install [**OpenVINO™ integration with TensorFlow** alongside the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ Toolkit](./docs/INSTALL.md#install-openvino-integration-with-tensorflow-pypi-release-alongside-the-intel-distribution-of-openvino-toolkit-for-vad-m-support).

For more details on installation please refer to [INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md), and for build from source options please refer to [BUILD.md](docs/BUILD.md)

## Configuration

Once you've installed **OpenVINO™ integration with TensorFlow**, you can use TensorFlow* to run inference using a trained model.

To see if **OpenVINO™ integration with TensorFlow** is properly installed, run

    python3 -c "import tensorflow as tf; print('TensorFlow version: ',tf.__version__);\
                import openvino_tensorflow; print(openvino_tensorflow.__version__)"

This should produce an output like:

        TensorFlow version:  2.9.2
        OpenVINO integration with TensorFlow version: b'2.2.0'
        OpenVINO version used for this build: b'2022.2.0'
        TensorFlow version used for this build: v2.9.2
        CXX11_ABI flag used for this build: 1

By default, Intel<sup>®</sup> CPU is used to run inference. However, you can change the default option to either Intel<sup>®</sup> integrated GPU or Intel<sup>®</sup> VPU for AI inferencing. Invoke the following function to change the hardware on which inferencing is done.

    openvino_tensorflow.set_backend('<backend_name>')

Supported backends include 'CPU', 'GPU', 'GPU_FP16', 'MYRIAD', and 'VAD-M'.

To determine what processing units are available on your system for inference, use the following function:

    openvino_tensorflow.list_backends()
For further performance improvements, it is advised to set the environment variable `OPENVINO_TF_CONVERT_VARIABLES_TO_CONSTANTS=1`. For more API calls and environment variables, see [USAGE.md](docs/USAGE.md).


## Examples
