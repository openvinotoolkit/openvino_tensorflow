# **OpenVINO™ integration with TensorFlow**

This repository contains the source code of **OpenVINO™ integration with TensorFlow**, a product that delivers [OpenVINO™](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/openvino-toolkit.html) inline optimizations and runtime needed for an enchanced level of TensorFlow compatiblity. It is designed for developers who want to get started with OpenVINO™ in their inferencing applications to enchance inferencing performance with minimal code modifications. **OpenVINO™ integration with TensorFlow** accelerates inference across many AI models on a variety of Intel<sup>®</sup> silicon such as:
- Intel<sup>®</sup> CPUs
- Intel<sup>®</sup> integrated GPUs
- Intel<sup>®</sup> Movidius™ Vision Processing Units - referred as VPU
- Intel<sup>®</sup> Vision Accelerator Design with 8 Intel Movidius™ MyriadX VPUs - referred as VAD-M or HDDL

Note: For maximum performance, efficiency, tooling customization, and hardware control, we recommend going beyond this component to adopt native OpenVINO APIs and its runtime.

## Installation
### Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 18.04
- Python 3.6, 3.7, or 3.8
- TensorFlow v2.4.1

Check our [Interactive Installation Table](https://openvinotoolkit.github.io/openvino_tensorflow/) for a menu of installation options. The table will help you configure the installation process.

### Install **OpenVINO™ integration with TensorFlow** alongside PyPi TensorFlow

This **OpenVINO™ integration with TensorFlow** package comes with pre-built libraries of OpenVINO™ version 2021.3 meaning you don't have to install OpenVINO™ separately. This package supports:
- Intel<sup>®</sup> CPUs
- Intel<sup>®</sup> integrated GPUs
- Intel<sup>®</sup> Movidius™ Vision Processing Units (VPUs)


        pip3 install -U pip==21.0.1
        pip3 install -U tensorflow==2.4.1
        pip3 install openvino-tensorflow


If you want to leverage Intel® Vision Accelerator Design with Movidius™ (VAD-M) for inference, install [**OpenVINO™ integration with TensorFlow** alongside the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ Toolkit](docs/BUILD.md#install-openvino-integration-with-tensorflow-alongside-the-intel-distribution-of-openvino-toolkit).

For more details on other modes of installation, please refer to [BUILD.md](docs/BUILD.md)

## Configuration

Once you've installed **OpenVINO™ integration with TensorFlow**, you can use TensorFlow to run inference using a trained model.

To see if **OpenVINO™ integration with TensorFlow** is properly installed, run

    python3 -c "import tensorflow as tf; print('TensorFlow version: ',tf.__version__);\
                import openvino_tensorflow; print(openvino_tensorflow.__version__)"

This should produce an output like:

        TensorFlow version:  2.4.1
        OpenVINO integration with TensorFlow version: b'0.5.0'
        OpenVINO version used for this build: b'2021.3'
        TensorFlow version used for this build: v2.4.1
        CXX11_ABI flag used for this build: 1
        OpenVINO integration with TensorFlow built with Grappler: False

By default, Intel<sup>®</sup> CPU is used to run inference. However, you can change the default option to either Intel<sup>®</sup> integrated GPU or Intel<sup>®</sup> VPU for AI inferencing. Invoke the following function to change the hardware inferencing is done on.

    openvino_tensorflow.set_backend('<backend_name>')

Supported backends include 'CPU', 'GPU', 'MYRIAD', and 'VAD-M'.

To determine what processing units are available on your system for inference, use the following function:

    openvino_tensorflow.list_backends()
For more API calls and environment variables, see [USAGE.md](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino_tensorflow/blob/master/docs/USAGE.md).
